This guide provides instructions for deploying the Armory Quick Start reference architecture on the AWS Cloud. This Quick Start provides a nearly continuous deployment foundation for AWS Cloud infrastructures. It deploys the Armory platform, a developer-based view of software delivery, according to AWS best practices and guidelines. It is target agnostic, so teams can deploy their code at scale to any and all clouds using a single path to production. For more information, see https://docs.armory.io/docs/[Armory Docs^].
