Armory provides a scalable and flexible platform for automating software delivery. To help companies deploy software into multiple clouds, the core of Armory’s platform is powered by Spinnaker, an open-source, continuous-delivery platform developed by Netflix and Google. Continuous delivery is a process that builds production software on a consistent basis.

With Armory's integrations, you can automate your code from commit to production, where users can then monitor applications, scale up, scale down, roll back, or roll forward—all of these actions can be viewed in Armory and automated. In addition to 24-hour support, Spinnaker’s foundation adds proprietary features that support enterprise operations.
