This Quick Start provides one deployment option:

* *Deploy Armory Enterprise into a new VPC (end-to-end deployment)*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys Armory Enterprise into an Amazon EKS cluster in this new VPC.

This Quick Start lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and Amazon EKS settings, as discussed later in this guide.
