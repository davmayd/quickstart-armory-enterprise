The Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.
* In the public subnets:
** A Linux bastion host, configured for Kubernetes, in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in the private subnets.
** A managed network address translation (NAT) gateway to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.
* In the private subnets:
** A group of Kubernetes nodes.
** ElastiCache Redis for caching storage for Orca and Clouddriver.
** Amazon Aurora for persistent storage of Orca and Clouddriver assets.
* Amazon EKS for the underlying Kubernetes infrastructure and platform.
* Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) for persistent storage of Armory objects.
* An Armory Operator installation in an Amazon EKS cluster, which creates the Kubernetes control plane.
